<p>This is an exploration of K-Means Clustering using the Wine dataset provided by R.</p>
<p>We write an algorithm to create <span class="math inline">\(k=3\)</span> clusters with <span class="math inline">\(m=50\)</span> repititions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(wine, package=&quot;rattle&quot;)
n &lt;- 178
# n is the number of data points
k &lt;- 3
# k is the number of clusters
p &lt;- 13
# p is the number of variables, once we have taken out the type variable
m &lt;- 50
# m is the number of times the algorithm is repeated.

cluster_center &lt;- matrix(rep(0,k*p), ncol = p)
distances &lt;- rep(0,k)
wine_matrix &lt;- cbind(as.matrix(wine[,-1]), rep(0,n))

for (i in 1:m){
  if (i == 1){
    sample &lt;- sample(1:n,k,replace = FALSE)
    for (j in 1:k){
      cluster_center[j,] &lt;- wine_matrix[sample[j],-(p+1)]
    }
  }
  
  # This section of code sets k=3 initial cluster centers to be three different 
  # points in the data set.
  
  for (s in 1:n){
    for (t in 1:k){
      distances[t] &lt;- sqrt(sum((cluster_center[t,] - wine_matrix[s,-(p+1)])^2))
    }
    # Finds distances to all of the cluster centers.
    cluster_number &lt;- which(distances == min(distances))
    # Determines which number cluster is closest.
    wine_matrix[s,p+1] &lt;- cluster_number
    # Records the cluster number on each data point.
  }  
  for (j in 1:k){
    wine_cluster &lt;- wine_matrix[wine_matrix[,p+1] == j,]
    for (u in 1:p){
      cluster_center[j,u] &lt;- mean(wine_cluster[,u]) 
      # Center of data within cluster j.
    }
  }
}

# Notice that the output is a matrix. The rows of the matrix correspond to the data points in the wine data set. The final column gives the cluster of that point after m repitions of the algorithm.</code></pre>
<p>Now, we plot the clusters.</p>
